# Debug Notes

## Status

No active product defect. Preserve any dogfood failure before correction.

## Reproduction

Not applicable at architecture kickoff.

## Evidence

- The first branch creation attempt was denied because Git refs live in the original worktree metadata outside the temporary checkout sandbox.
- The exact `git switch -c codex/v12-ide-run-loop` operation succeeded after bounded escalation.

## Stable Evidence

- The template checker rejected the first feature package with eleven exact missing-heading diagnostics.
- No code, package, or runtime behavior was involved in that failure.
- The first package-approval command stopped with `TypeError` before writing approval or launching an agent.
- The preserved package envelope exposes root `compilationDigest` and `packageDigest` fields and no `compilation` object.

## Failure Classification

Workflow artifact conformance and host integration mismatch: `fix`, then `diagnose`.

## Hypotheses

- Confirmed: the dogfood host copied a nonexistent nested path from an assumed envelope shape.
- Rejected: compilation or package rendering omitted the digest; both exact root digest fields are present.

## Experiments

- Add only the required structural headings and rerun the same checker.
- Read the preserved envelope keys without mutation, correct only the field access, require both digest strings, and rerun approval-bound verification.

## Next Diagnostic Trigger

Enter `diagnose` if compilation, package verification, raw handoff verification, fan-in assessment, or integrated verification fails non-obviously or repeatedly.

## Foundation Attempt 1

### Reproduction

Launch the approval-bound Foundation Revision-1 contract from the temporary `C:\tmp\swecircuit-identity-main` worktree and attempt its first scoped edit with native `apply_patch`.

### Evidence

- All 22 declared sources matched their exact byte and SHA-256 bindings.
- Native `apply_patch` failed before mutation with the recurring Windows sandbox refresh error.
- Wrapper and escalated wrapper invocations were denied.
- All six target files remained unchanged.
- The exact 3,776-byte handoff verified through V11 with outcome `block` and raw digest `sha256:81471e5dd7363a856e0825b35c337aa7bd0ac507b5e9b39d34418eed71aca008`.

### Classification

Host edit-capability mismatch: `block`, then revise the reviewed execution authority without changing product scope.

### Next Action

Compile Foundation Revision 2 with the same source and write ceiling plus explicit permission for a precondition-hash-guarded PowerShell fallback only after native `apply_patch` fails before mutation.
## Foundation Revision 2 Integration

### Reproduction

Run the complete existing kernel test suite after the package-bound Foundation Revision-2 handoff verifies `pass`.

### Evidence

- Format, lint, typecheck, and build passed independently.
- The suite passed 369 of 370 tests.
- `test/json-kernel.test.mjs` rejected the five new runtime diagnostic definitions because `schemas/v1alpha1/diagnostic-catalog.json` still ends at `SC4313`.
- The six-file Foundation authority did not include the normative catalog, and no Foundation file needs correction.

### Classification

Cross-phase ownership omission: `fix` the downstream public-integration contract before compiling it. This is not a recurring product defect and does not justify patching the verified Foundation output.

### Next Action

Add the normative diagnostic catalog to the public-integration source and write scope, retain the failing test as a required downstream gate, and continue only after independent Foundation review finds no in-scope defect.
## Foundation Boundary Classification

### Reproduction

Create a valid empty session from the exact approved Foundation Revision-2 package, add one schema-valid accepted row whose canonical 1,398,104-character base64 value decodes to 1,048,578 bytes, recompute the session digest, and restore it.

### Evidence

- Declared `rawHandoffBytes`: 1,048,576.
- Declared `rawHandoffBase64Chars`: 1,398,104.
- Actual decoded probe size: 1,048,578.
- Actual diagnostic: `SC4401`.
- Required diagnostic for raw resource excess: `SC4402`.

### Classification

Confirmed Foundation resource-boundary classification defect: `fix`.

### Root Cause

`decodeCanonicalBase64` collapses malformed encoding and decoded-byte overflow into one `null` result, so `validateAcceptedHandoffs` cannot preserve the contract's distinct invalid-input and resource-limit routes.

### Smallest Causal Fix

Return a bounded decode result that distinguishes invalid encoding from decoded-byte overflow, map only overflow to `SC4402`, and add a real-package regression proving both classifications without changing the wire contract.
