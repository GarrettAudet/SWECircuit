# Root Cause Analysis

## Status

Active for the first V12 dogfood host-integration failure.

## Reproduction

Run `node docs/specs/v12-ide-run-loop/evidence/architecture/run-specialist-compiler.mjs approve` against the rendered Revision-1 architecture package.

## Stable Evidence

The command stopped before approval with a `TypeError` at `specialistPackage.compilation.contentDigest`. The exact preserved envelope has root keys `compilationDigest`, `packageDigest`, `manifest`, and `files`.

## Competing Hypotheses

- Rendering omitted compilation data.
- JSON serialization removed a nested field.
- The host assumed the wrong public envelope shape.

## Confirmed Root Cause

The dogfood host used an unverified nested field path instead of the public root `RenderedSpecialistPackage.compilationDigest` field.

## Fix

Read the root digest pair, assert both values are strings, then bind approval and package verification to those exact values.

## Regression Coverage

The corrected approval command must write the exact expected pair and pass `verifySpecialistPackage`. Later V12 host examples must test envelope-shape access through public types rather than untyped JSON assumptions.

## Durable Learning

Host scripts must validate deserialized public-envelope roots before constructing approval expectations. Digest integrity cannot repair a caller that reads the wrong field.

## Memory Update

Keep the finding in this feature package until the V12 host protocol and tests demonstrate the durable prevention pattern.
