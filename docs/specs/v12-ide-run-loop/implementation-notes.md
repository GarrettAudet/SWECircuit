# Implementation Notes

## Status

Architecture passed. Foundation Revision 2 is package-verified and under integration review; downstream implementation has not started.

## Baseline

- Released V11.1 main: `c2f974d2288fc510cb8388fbc8e6abe9fd5d9e8c`.
- Active branch: `codex/v12-ide-run-loop`.
- Current host: Codex IDE with external subagent capability; SWECircuit core remains the provider-neutral contract and verifier.

## Dogfood Observations

- The visible kickoff made the current stage, artifact, assumption, and host boundary explicit.
- The current IDE exposes actual subagents, so exact compiled contracts can be materialized without adding provider APIs to core.
- Exact search selected four task-shaped agents over the eligible serial baseline because projected makespan fell from 26 to 15 with zero conflict pairs.
- The first host approval attempt exposed a wrong untyped envelope field assumption and stopped before launch. Exact envelope inspection, a root-field assertion, and approval-bound verification corrected it.
- The first launch handle was lost from visible context during host output compaction. The host had no list-agents operation, so the integration owner recovered the exact handle from the caller-owned session ledger instead of launching a duplicate. V12 must make the approved roster and accepted handoffs recoverable from the persisted session value.
- The first specialist returned a 13,011-byte raw handoff. The host preserved the returned string as exact UTF-8 bytes before interpretation; sandbox-specific persistence remained an external host concern.
- A narrow host verifier now authenticates each raw handoff, computes the integration blueprint's exact V11 transitive fan-in, and keeps verification evidence separate from raw source artifacts.
- V11 authenticated 52,161 raw Wave-1 bytes, found all three required `pass` handoffs, and returned `integrationReady: true` for the synthesis blueprint.
- Foundation Revision 1 preserved a verified `block` after the host could not edit the temporary worktree with native `apply_patch` or its wrappers.
- Foundation Revision 2 retained the exact product and six-file write ceiling while adding one explicit, precondition-hash-guarded PowerShell fallback. Its 9,166-byte raw `pass` handoff verified against compilation `sha256:3c76ddb9c2c25b510d7f6d36f701f7271db941f019d3615946afa58d2207b435` and package `sha256:be7fc744d42e29c19ee3a4a5703ca538f3a3c0b3699db41cf79b491b51cf7c04`.
- Independent format, lint, typecheck, and build checks passed. The full suite exposed one cross-phase integration obligation: runtime `SC4401`-`SC4405` definitions must be added to the normative diagnostic catalog.
- The public-integration contract now owns that catalog update. Future implementation contracts carry the same bounded fallback so the known host limitation does not trigger another unproductive revision.
- An independent maximum-length base64 probe exposed an in-scope boundary-classification defect: 1,398,104 canonical base64 characters can decode to 1,048,578 bytes, but Foundation Revision 2 returned `SC4401` instead of `SC4402`. Foundation Revision 3 is a minimal compiled correction with one production file and one persistent regression test.
