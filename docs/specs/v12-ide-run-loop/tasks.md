# Tasks

## Status

T006 in progress: release-correction revisions 6 through 8, the current full pre-freeze gate, and V11 trust-root revision 35 pass. Candidate 2 passed its canonical gate but is retired after fail-closed R2 preparation. Candidate 3 freeze, canonical receipt, and R2 independent review remain.

## Task List

- [x] T001: Create the V12 branch and feature package from released V11.1.
  Verification: branch parent and active artifacts identify `c2f974d2288fc510cb8388fbc8e6abe9fd5d9e8c`.
- [x] T002: Compile the architecture work through V11.1.
  Verification: reviewed GoalContract, serial baseline, selected partition, compilation digest, package digest, and verified package are preserved.
- [x] T003: Execute and verify architecture specialists.
  Verification: exact raw handoffs verify; architecture integration has complete transitive `pass` fan-in.
- [x] T004: Freeze the V12 ADR and implementation contract.
  Verification: product, lifecycle, authority, API, and test obligations map to AC1-AC9 with no blocking decision.
- [x] T005: Compile and implement disjoint V12 work units.
  Verification: every code or documentation change maps to an exact task-shaped contract and handoff.
- [ ] T006: Run integrated verification and independent review.
  Verification: focused tests, canonical gate, package consumer, checker matrix, dogfood, and reviewer evidence pass.
- [ ] T007: Close memory, milestone, publication, and owner merge gate.
  Verification: exact candidate, CI, residual risks, and user-facing overview are preserved.

## Parallelization

T003 ran three read-only architecture analyses in parallel and one dependent synthesis. T005 froze the shared session foundation, then ran transition and inspection in parallel with disjoint write scopes. T006 ran adversarial verification and IDE dogfood in parallel, then launched three exact read-only release reviewers in one wave. Their complete package-bound roster routed `fix` before merge; revisions 1-8 now preserve the correction chain, and the replacement R2 wave remains pending.

## Out Of Scope

- Provider or model routing.
- Automatic subagent launch from core.
- Universal scheduling, retries, cancellation, or crash recovery.
- Automatic Git merge or memory mutation.
