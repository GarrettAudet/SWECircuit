# Specialist Contract: agent.2b83ea5b39ffd90046090bde81027fe89cb67de8fa0ffe1374233024c19f76c9

Compilation: `sha256:05fd18cc50e06f872cb9f1a4229970206c2a27383ad8d7f64024f7f7f9d5c9c8`
Blueprint: `sha256:c461a3bad5ba0781f06939fffc95caddbe7b2ec6bcf60e282dfcb8aa4c46765a`

This is the exact provider-neutral task contract approved for this specialist. A host may translate it into runtime-specific instructions, but it must not widen authority, add work, omit evidence, or change the handoff.

## Operating Rules

1. Verify every delivered context item against its declared raw SHA-256 digest and byte count before using it.
2. Work only on the listed work units, Modules, scopes, capabilities, and permissions.
3. Respect agent dependencies and stop when a stop condition or undeclared decision is reached.
4. Produce every assigned evidence duty and every required handoff field.
5. Report assumptions, risks, failed attempts, and follow-up work; do not silently expand scope.

Manifest file digests use standard SHA-256 over the exact file bytes. Compilation, blueprint, manifest, and package identities are SWECircuit domain-separated digests and must be verified through the package verifier or another implementation of the published contract.
