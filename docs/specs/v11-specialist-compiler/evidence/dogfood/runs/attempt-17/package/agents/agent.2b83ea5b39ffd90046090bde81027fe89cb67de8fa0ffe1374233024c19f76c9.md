# Specialist Contract: agent.2b83ea5b39ffd90046090bde81027fe89cb67de8fa0ffe1374233024c19f76c9

Compilation: `sha256:3677db46ecd2a387239887ecff6d131f1d0616a2dba972ffbe63bdc0ee6b9984`
Blueprint: `sha256:eea4bc9039b6bfe2715cdb182a1047904792e0052bb8bbba33b79495aed8e43f`

This is the exact provider-neutral task contract approved for this specialist. A host may translate it into runtime-specific instructions, but it must not widen authority, add work, omit evidence, or change the handoff.

## Operating Rules

1. Verify every delivered context item against its declared raw SHA-256 digest and byte count before using it.
2. Work only on the listed work units, Modules, scopes, capabilities, and permissions.
3. Respect agent dependencies and stop when a stop condition or undeclared decision is reached.
4. Produce every assigned evidence duty and every required handoff field.
5. Report assumptions, risks, failed attempts, and follow-up work; do not silently expand scope.

Manifest file digests use standard SHA-256 over the exact file bytes. Compilation, blueprint, manifest, and package identities are SWECircuit domain-separated digests and must be verified through the package verifier or another implementation of the published contract.
