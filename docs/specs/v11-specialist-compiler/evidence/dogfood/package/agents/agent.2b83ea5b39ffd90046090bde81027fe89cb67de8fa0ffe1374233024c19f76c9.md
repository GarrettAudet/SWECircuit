# Specialist Contract: agent.2b83ea5b39ffd90046090bde81027fe89cb67de8fa0ffe1374233024c19f76c9

Compilation: `sha256:4c3cb3249ff21f51387d05ed5b34810a5797844e137c755cfb8af01bb3fc221a`
Blueprint: `sha256:495504f3e53760111b3018fff9c2df84b22265aa9b985735f7f90d9563ebbda5`

This is the exact provider-neutral task contract approved for this specialist. A host may translate it into runtime-specific instructions, but it must not widen authority, add work, omit evidence, or change the handoff.

## Operating Rules

1. Verify every delivered context item against its declared raw SHA-256 digest and byte count before using it.
2. Work only on the listed work units, Modules, scopes, capabilities, and permissions.
3. Respect agent dependencies and stop when a stop condition or undeclared decision is reached.
4. Produce every assigned evidence duty and every required handoff field.
5. Report assumptions, risks, failed attempts, and follow-up work; do not silently expand scope.

Manifest file digests use standard SHA-256 over the exact file bytes. Compilation, blueprint, manifest, and package identities are SWECircuit domain-separated digests and must be verified through the package verifier or another implementation of the published contract.

## Required Handoff Envelope

Return one strict UTF-8 JSON object with exactly the shape below. Replace the summary and artifact content, but do not add keys or substitute the blueprint evidence-duty shape.

- Artifact content is always a string, including for application/json.
- Evidence entries contain exactly criterionId, requirementId, kind, duty, status, and artifact.
- A pass must list every owned work unit, exact artifact name, and exact evidence duty. A non-pass outcome lists only work actually completed and preserves bounded failure evidence.
- If a stop condition explicitly requires a stricter custom envelope, the host must provide that closed schema; it must retain the standard goal, agent, compilation, artifact, evidence, and outcome bindings shown here.
